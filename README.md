# Export-Layers-To-Files-Last-Location-2-Part
A two part version of the original â€œExport Layers To Files - Last Location" script.
The "1 of 2" script is only required to be run to set a new default save path. If the save location doesn't need to be changed, then the "2 of2" script only needs to be run to continue to use the previously saved file path.
